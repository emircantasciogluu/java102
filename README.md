# Java102 - Learning Repository

This repository is a continuation of my **Java learning journey**, building upon the foundations of [Java101](https://github.com/kullaniciAdiniz/java101).  
Here, I explore **advanced concepts** such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in depth
- Collections Framework
- Algorithms and problem solving
- More complex, real-world inspired projects

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each project is organized under its own package with descriptive names (e.g., `Project01XYZ`, `Project02ABC`).

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kullaniciAdiniz/java102.git
